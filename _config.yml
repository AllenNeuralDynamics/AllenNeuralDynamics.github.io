description: The Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics explores the brain’s activity, at the level of individual neurons and the whole brain, to reveal how we interpret our environments to make decisions. We aim to discover how neural signaling – and changes in that signaling – allow the brain to perform complex but fundamental computations and drive flexible behaviors. Our experiments and openly shared resources will shed light on behavior, memory, how we handle uncertainty and risk, how humans and other animals chase rewards – and how some or all of these complicated cognitive functions go awry in neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, ADHD or addiction.

# Available positions

## Molecular Anatomy

[Scientist I - Machine Learning in Circuit Tracing](https://alleninstitute.hrmdirect.com/employment/job-opening.php?req=1679008)
This Scientist will work with other quantitative and experimental scientists on high-priority problems in neuronal reconstruction and analysis that include (i) topology-preserving approaches to neuronal segmentation, (ii) deep learning-based analysis of morpho-molecular datasets, and (iii) high performance computing.  

[Scientist I â€“ Multi-regional neural circuits, Thalamus anatomy](https://alleninstitute.hrmdirect.com/employment/job-opening.php?req=1835514)
This Scientist will lead a project to uncover the organizational logic of signal routing from subcortical areas to the frontal cortex via the thalamus at the level of defined cell types. This individual will leverage state-of-the-art imaging methods, molecular and transgenic resources to generate foundational anatomy data needed to study contributions of identified cell types within thalamic circuits during flexible behaviors.  


[Software Engineer II - Analysis of Large-scale (brain-wide) Microscopy Data](https://alleninstitute.hrmdirect.com/employment/job-opening.php?req=1814849)
This software engineer will join a program to understand how neuron types from different brain regions are connected and whose activity underlies complex behavior and decision-making. The development and deployment of these workflows will be instrumental for the success of multiple projects at the Allen Institute and elsewhere, which will provide ample opportunity for growth and career development.  


[Research Associate I](https://alleninstitute.hrmdirect.com/employment/job-opening.php?req=1850165)
This Research Associate will support ongoing research projects investigating large-scale circuitry of the brain. Experimental approaches include tissue-sectioning, tissue clearing, immunohistochemistry, and microscopy.  


## Discovery Science

[Principal Scientist](https://alleninstitute.hrmdirect.com/employment/job-opening.php?req=1848423) and [Senior Scientist](https://alleninstitute.hrmdirect.com/employment/job-opening.php?req=1848402); Systems Neuroscience and Behavior
These Scientists will lead a program in behavioral and system neuroscience. They will establish robust and flexible behavioral paradigms using the mouse as a model system. This platform will be used in conjunction with in vivo electrophysiology, optical physiology, and molecular anatomy to probe the mechanisms underlying learning and decision-making.  


[Scientist II - Theory](https://alleninstitute.hrmdirect.com/employment/job-opening.php?req=1850150)
This Scientist will model neural computation at the level of neural circuits and dynamics. This individual will analyze multi-dimensional neurophysiological and behavioral data to extract principles underlying neural computation.  

## Scientific Computing
[Scientific Data Engineer III](https://alleninstitute.hrmdirect.com/employment/job-opening.php?req=1839117)
This skilled data engineer will design and operate a modern, cloud-first data platform that enables multiple scientific teams collecting peta-scale biological datasets to manage metadata, orchestrate automated computational workflows, and share data with the neuroscience community adhering to FAIR standards. 

[Software Engineer II - Image Registration](https://alleninstitute.hrmdirect.com/employment/job-opening.php?req=1839217)
This machine vision software engineer will join a program to understand the long-range connectivity patterns of neurons whose activity underlies complex behavior and decision-making. In this role, the candidate will build robust, scalable image processing and analysis pipelines. A key component of these pipelines is multimodal image registration between individuals and standardized coordinate systems. 

[Principal Product Manager, Data Integration](https://alleninstitute.hrmdirect.com/employment/job-opening.php?req=1825885)
This individual will engage deeply with both internal and external community stakeholders to ensure the success of our Open Science mission. He or she will guide the design of data, tools and standards and establish them in the broader neuroscience community.

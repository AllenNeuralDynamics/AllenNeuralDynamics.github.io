The Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics explores the brain’s activity, at the level of individual neurons and the whole brain, to reveal how we interpret our environments to make decisions. We aim to discover how neural signaling – and changes in that signaling – allow the brain to perform complex but fundamental computations and drive flexible behaviors. Our experiments and openly shared resources will shed light on behavior, memory, how we handle uncertainty and risk, how humans and other animals chase rewards – and how some or all of these complicated cognitive functions go awry in neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, ADHD or addiction. 

The Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics (AIND) is committed to FAIR, Open, and Reproducible science. We therefore share all of the data we collect publicly with rich metadata as near to the time of collection as possible. We share data at all stages of the data lifecycle, including preliminary data collected during methods development, processed data that we are actively improving, or highly curated data used in a publication.

We have two cloud buckets publicly available:
* [aind-open-data]({% link data.md %}#aind-open-data): open access raw and processed data collected by AIND
* [aind-benchmark-data/ephys-compression]({% link data.md %}#aind-benchmark-dataephys-compression): curated raw electrophysiology data from the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics used to benchmark compression algorithms
